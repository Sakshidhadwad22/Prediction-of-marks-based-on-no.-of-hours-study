In this scores.csv file we only 2 columns which is hour and scores

Goal=we need to predict the if we study for particular hours then how much marks we will get

for that we need to use machine learning algorithm 

in this specific case i have use simple linear regression and train data with algorithm so that if i have to check if i study for particular hour then approximatly how much marks I'll get
